pyUnRAR2 is a Python (ctypes-based) wrapper around the free UnRAR.dll (Windows) or command-line unrar binary (Unix).

It is an modified version of Jimmy Retzlaff's pyUnRAR - more simple,
stable and foolproof, with Unix support added.
Notice that it has INCOMPATIBLE interface.

It enables reading and unpacking of archives created with the RAR/WinRAR archivers.

New in recent versions: support for overwriting/skipping files during extraction; Win64 support; fixed some GC-related problems.
